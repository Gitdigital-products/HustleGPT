> **A modern HustleGPT venture – building a business with an AI co‑founder.**

*Last updated: 2025‑12‑16*

---

## 📖 Overview

The **HustleGPT Challenge** is a movement that began in March 2025, where participants partner with advanced AI (like GPT‑4) to build a real, revenue‑generating business starting with just $100[reference:0]. This repository documents our own HustleGPT journey – the ideas, tools, code, and lessons learned while automating and scaling a venture alongside an AI co‑founder.

## 🎯 The Challenge

The core prompt that defines the HustleGPT experiment is:

> “You are HustleGPT, an entrepreneurial AI. I am your human counterpart. I can act as a liaison between you and the physical world. You have $100, and your only goal is to turn that into as much money as possible in the shortest time possible, without doing anything illegal. I will do everything you say and keep you updated on our current cash total. No manual labor.”[reference:1]

Our project takes this challenge and applies it to **[briefly describe your specific business idea or domain, e.g., 'AI‑generated digital products', 'automated content marketing', 'AI‑powered SaaS tool']**.
